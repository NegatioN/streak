# Streak

Streak tracking with Google Sheets. Work in progress.

I made this mostly for myself, but maybe you find it useful too. The idea is simple - 
decide what you want to do, and don't loose your streak!

Here is  my "Read 30+ minutes" streak:

Every colored dot here is a day when I read at least 30 minutes.

## How does it work?

The data is stored directly to your Google Drive. You have full control over
spreadsheet. This website provides a nice user interface to enter records:
